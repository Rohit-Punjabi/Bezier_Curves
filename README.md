# Bezier_Curves
An academic project for the MAT500: Curves and Surfaces class at DigiPen Institute of Technology. Created an application that generates Bezier Curves based on control points that places by the user.

The Curves are calculated using the following three methods:

1. De-Casteljau algorithm or Nested Linear Interpolation (NLI)
2. Bernstein Polynomials (BB-Form)
3. Midpoint Subdivision

Made the application using Qt 5.15.0 and qcustomplot library
